# Bitburner script files
These are scripts i've written for the javascript webgame Bitburner which is playable on Steam or https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/
It's a 'hacking' game focused around writing your own javascript code to interact with the game's own extensive library of functions, using these functions you can progress further in the game or automate aspects of it.

It's been great for practicing fundamentals regarding arrays and objects.
more info on aforementioned library is available - https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.ns.md

Some of these files have been pushed to Steam guides
